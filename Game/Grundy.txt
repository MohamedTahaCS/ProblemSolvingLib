Sprague–Grundy theorem
The Sprague–Grundy theorem2 generalizes the strategy used in nim to all
games that fulfil the following requirements:
• There are two players who move alternately.
• The game consists of states, and the possible moves in a state do not depend
on whose turn it is.
• The game ends when a player cannot make a move.
• The game surely ends sooner or later.
• The players have complete information about the states and allowed moves,
and there is no randomness in the game.
The idea is to calculate for each game state a Grundy number that corresponds
to the number of sticks in a nim heap. When we know the Grundy numbers of all
states, we can play the game like the nim game.

					Grundy numbers
The Grundy number of a game state is
mex({g1, g2,..., gn}),
where g1, g2,..., gn are the Grundy numbers of the states to which we can move,
and the mex function gives the smallest nonnegative number that is not in the
set. For example, mex({0,1,3}) Æ 2. If there are no possible moves in a state, its
Grundy number is 0

The Grundy number of a losing state is 0, and the Grundy number of a winning
state is a positive number.
						Grundy’s game
Sometimes a move in a game divides the game into subgames that are independent
of each other. In this case, the Grundy number of the game is
mex({g1, g2,..., gn}),
where n is the number of possible moves and
g[k] = a[k,1] xor a[k,2] xor .. xor a[k, m]
where move k generates subgames with Grundy numbers ak,1,ak,2,...,ak,m.
An example of such a game is Grundy’s game. Initially, there is a single
heap that contains n sticks. On each turn, the player chooses a heap and divides
it into two nonempty heaps such that the heaps are of different size. The player
who makes the last move wins the game.
Let f (n) be the Grundy number of a heap that contains n sticks. The Grundy
number can be calculated by going through all ways to divide the heap into two
heaps. For example, when n = 8, the possibilities are 1Å7, 2Å6 and 3Å5, so
f[8] = mex{f[1] xor f[7], f[2] xor f[6], f[3] xor f[5]);
